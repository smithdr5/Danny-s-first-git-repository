# Danny-s-first-git-repository
My first ever Git Repository. Feel free to provide insight!
Hey everyone, my name is Danny, and here is the code to the very first webpage that I have ever built, which is one for a friend's import/export business out in California. I'm in the process of redesigning the layout, as its original was in an elementary style. I appreciate constructive criticism, and look forward to hearing any insights that would make this project better! Thanks!
